# üé¨ Sentiment Analysis with Manual Naive Bayes (from Scratch)

This project implements a **fully manual Naive Bayes classifier** to perform **sentiment analysis** on the [NLTK movie_reviews dataset](https://www.nltk.org/howto/corpus.html). No prebuilt classifiers are used ‚Äî everything is coded from scratch, including tokenization, vocabulary building, and probability computation.

---

## üìå What is This?

A simple yet powerful sentiment classification pipeline written in pure Python + NLTK that:
- Classifies movie reviews as **positive** or **negative**
- Uses **manual probability computation** (not `NaiveBayesClassifier`)
- Evaluates with real metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**
- Preprocesses the text completely (cleaning, filtering, normalization)
- Shows **most informative features** that drive the predictions

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Loading**  
   Uses `movie_reviews` corpus from NLTK (2000 reviews, balanced pos/neg).

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing:
     - Punctuation
     - Stopwords
     - Numbers
     - URLs
     - Very short/meaningless words
     - Custom non-informative tokens (`just`, `even`, etc.)

3. **Vocabulary Filtering**
   - Removes words with frequency < 3
   - Keeps only top 4000 most frequent words

4. **Training (Manual Naive Bayes)**
   - Count-based word statistics per class
   - Uses **log-count smoothing**
   - Applies **class prior bias** to improve recall

5. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 (for each class)
   - Tested on 20% of the dataset
   - Balanced and interpretable results

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn
```

2. Run the script in Jupyter/Colab or local Python:

```python
# Download corpus (first run only)
import nltk
nltk.download('movie_reviews')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

3. Execute the script.

## üß™ To Do / Ideas

- Add visualization for word frequencies
- Add confusion matrix plotting
- Add TF-IDF support (still manually)
- Extend to multiclass sentiment
