## 🔍 Project Highlights

### 📌 `project-sentiment`
- Classical (Naive Bayes, SVM) and Transformer-based (BERT) sentiment classifiers.
- Dataset: Movie reviews (IMDB).
- Output: Positive / Negative prediction with metrics.

### 📌 `project-summarization`
- Extractive (TextRank) and Abstractive (T5, BART) methods.
- Dataset: CNN/DailyMail or custom documents.
- Output: Summaries with ROUGE evaluation.

### 📌 `project-translation`
- Seq2Seq models with attention mechanism for machine translation.
- Dataset: English ↔ French sample corpora.
- Evaluation: BLEU score.

### 📌 `project-ner`
- Named Entity Recognition using CRF and Transformers.
- Dataset: CoNLL-2003.
- Output: Tagged entities (ORG, LOC, PER).

### 📌 `project-chatbot`
- Simple rule-based chatbot with predefined intents.
- Easily extendable for real use cases.

| Project         | Evaluation Metrics        | Example Results               |
|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Sentiment       | Accuracy, F1               | ~90% on IMDB                  |
| Summarization   | ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L | R1: 0.35, R2: 0.15 (T5 model) |
| Translation     | BLEU Score                 | BLEU ~ 25–35                  |
| NER             | Precision, Recall, F1      | F1 ~ 0.88                     |
| Chatbot         | Manual Testing             | Responses based on intents    |

## 🧩 Extend This Repo

You can easily add more modules:

1. Create a new folder like `project-topic-modeling`.
2. Follow the same structure: `data/`, `models/`, `train.py`, `evaluate.py`, etc.
3. Add a short `README.md` inside that folder.
